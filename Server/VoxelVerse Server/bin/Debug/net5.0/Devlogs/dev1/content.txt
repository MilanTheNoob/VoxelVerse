Hello everyone! This is the very first devlog, I have been working on this prototype for only 2 weeks and is very, VERY far away from the wanted end result.

What I have done

1. Basic terrain generation with trees & rock structures being generated.
2. Inventory system that allows you to break blocks, craft more blocks using them & then placing them back in the world. I am unsure if this feature will stay the same or be kept in the game since people might perceive the game just as a Minecraft clone because of this.
3. A simple storage system where you can craft a barrel using two wood blocks and place it & interact with it.
4. Simple saving system that saves your settings & world data separately. So in the future you will be able to play different worlds like Minecraft. (Right now there is only world you can play)
5. And some basic eye candy. This includes: UI animations, basic fog, very smooth 8x8 textures & CubeWorld inspired UI 

And some known bugs with this first version:

1. When breaking a block on a chunk border the face on the border will fail to render, even allowing you to get underneath the world
2. If you break blocks straight down you will eventually fall underneath the map as there is no unbreakable layer of blocks underneath the terrain
3. The saving system is generally quite unstable, with corruption being caused when the game isn't closed correctly. And it is quite slow when it does save.

That is currently it for development these past two weeks, recently I have 'acquired' Covid so development slowed down considerably. In regards for the next devlog these are my intentions:

1. Improve the LOD system for the terrain generation, and optimise all the super messy code for generation to improve the render distance
2. Add some more variation to the terrain, have biomes be more distinct & have more variants to trees & rocks.
3. Fix some of the existing bugs, and add some more for the next devlog (:
4. Improve the feel of the game, this includes: audio, more UI animations, animations when generating, terrain gradient, etc

Thats it for the first (hopefully historical at some point) devlog. Keep tuned in with the community to see more!
