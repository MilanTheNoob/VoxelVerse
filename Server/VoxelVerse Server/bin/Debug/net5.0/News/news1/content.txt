Hey everyone! Welcome to the first launcher for the game, you might be wondering why this exists considering the game is in such an early stage of development.

The reasoning is I think it would be great for the community to shape the game and have an influence on the end result. So from now until its end of life I will be keeping this community as active & inundated on the game as possible.
As of the release of this post, the first Prototype has been created & uploaded and the launcher is exiting the final stages of  closed development.

Let me know what you think of all the new stuff happening in the new forums!
Happy Exploring!
